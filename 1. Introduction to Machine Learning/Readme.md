Hi guys, this is the first part of the tutorial, the part include 3 chapter, I put the content in the .pdf file.

one note that during the whole tutorial, I assume that you have a basic foundation in python. In case you are a newbie, please go back to learn something about python, include:
* python syntax
* numpy library
* matplotlib to draw graph
* object oriented programming
* you should distinguish the difference between CPU and GPU.I just want you to take a browse through the explantion why people often use GPU in AI fields instead of CPU.
# The content include
* **ethical and Law:** Every Prof said these are neccessary, I approve that,  But sometimes, we don't like the right path.
* **NeuralNetwork part1:** give you some overall concept of machine learning and it's subset , Deep learning, just a browse to understand about the neccessary and history of the thing what people call AI.
* **NeuralNetwork part2:** This is the start of building a neural network, its help you to understand the fundamantal math inside a Neural network.
# project:
try to build a neural network by yourself using numpy. 
**the task is:**
create a class NeuralNet() with input is the training set (X,Y), the number of layers, the number of hidden nodes in a layer.

Don't forget the Weight_Intialize, Add_bias, ForwardPro, BackwardPro, Loss, activation_function is the mandatory of Neural Net.

than build a train function with input is number of epochs and learning rate, when you call NeuralNet().train() it start to training your model.

build a test function to do the testing on your testing set
