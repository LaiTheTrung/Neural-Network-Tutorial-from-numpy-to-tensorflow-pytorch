Hi guys, before digging to the AI brain, :shipit: please give me a start :star: for all effort I spent for this git 
# Neural Network Tutorial Using NumPy/TensorFlow/pytorch
This repository contains a beginner-friendly tutorial on how to build a neural network from scratch using Python and the NumPy library. This tutorial aims to help you understand the fundamentals of neural networks and their implementation. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic understanding of feedforward neural networks and the knowledge to create your own simple neural network.

Moreover, I have updated my own miniprojects with explaination in this git, hope you will find the intersting in AI !!!

Neural network inspired is a term used to describe anything that is inspired by the structure or function of the human brain. This can include artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are computer programs that are designed to mimic the way the brain processes information.

ANNs have been used to solve a wide range of problems, including image classification, natural language processing, and machine translation. They are also used in many commercial products, such as self-driving cars and facial recognition software.


Consider using Machine Learning when:
* Have a complex task
* Have a large amount of data
* Have a lot of variables
* But no existing formula or equation


In addition to the examples above, neural network inspired research is also being conducted in a variety of other areas, such as:

Brain-computer interfaces that allow people to control computers with their minds.
Neuromorphic computing hardware that is designed to mimic the structure and function of the brain.
Artificial intelligence that can learn and adapt like humans.
